# Honors Project Description
The project will consist of building software for the nEXO project at SLAC in collaboration with Skyline College. I will be working with Professor Wamba to build software that can aid in the alignment of a laser beam and an optical fiber cable. This is otherwise known as beam steering. The laser light is used to generate electrons that drift in liquid xenon in order to determine the xenonâ€™s chemical purity. The best way to build this software will be what I am researching. Typically, the laser is aligned with two people collaborating in two different rooms. One is looking at an oscilloscope yelling at the other person in the other room, telling the second person how to adjust the laser beam alignment knobs so that the beam is reasonably aligned with the optical fiber cable. The hope is that the completed software will allow the person in the room with the knobs to work independently by providing a visual for them on how well aligned the laser beam is.

This project relates to the computer science and physics fields. We will be building this software in Python. The only requirement for this project is to attempt to complete a draft of the proposed software by the end of the semester.
